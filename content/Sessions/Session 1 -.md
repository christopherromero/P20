Genasi were Indigenous to the Augard. [[Saxum Dustrunner]]’s tribe is the [[Inrith Earthspeakers]]. (Earthspeaker is also a title for a ceremonial position in the tribe.) 

[[Earthspeaker Soot]] - older Genasi woman. Wise druid passing down rites held from generation to generation to connect to Earth Elemental Plane. Sand pit. Had a vision of the land, able to speak across distances and tap into the Earth Elemental Plane. Gained abilities to heal. 

[[Saxum Dustrunner]] impressed judges by building tools. 

Introduced:
3) [[Eskender Kumbukani]]
Human barbarian from an older time, BCE. Was a legendary warrior, ruled over a civilization until his death. Displaced in time until he ended up here. 

On the battlefield staging for war, felt a presence as the sun set. Demons told him, “You will be slain this day.” Army is abandoning him. Demonic creatures attacked him in waves, seemingly endless barrage.
[[Eskender Kumbukani]] is barreling through them, leaving dozens of corpses in his wake. Was plucked from the Material Plane, and returned hundreds if not thousands of years later. Reincarnated into a new body. 

To impress the judges, entered gladiatorial combat, fought with claws and teeth. 

Introduced:
1) [[Vale]]

Vale appears to be younger, average height, 5’ 8” to 5’ 9”, white hair and skin, whitened out eyes (no irises), and lives in the deep South of Augard. Black trousers, boots, linens, billowy shirt, black waistcoat. 

At night, in a cemetery behind a fancy estate. Hardened older man, Gideon, met Vale. “To succeed in your role, you must be able to perform at any hour of the day.” Vale is practicing what they discussed. Given a cube with intricate runes carved into them, told to memorize them. 

Impressed judges by using changeling abilities to pose as opponents, even judges, to show accuracy of replication. Use this to deceive other competitors and discover their weaknesses. 



Fast Forward to Caelkirk, southern Auguard

Caelkirk is a southwest desert, near mountains and forest.
2nd to Last Event in the Tournament. All party members arrive. A military base is commandeered to hold the 1,000 remaining contestants. All contestants are placed in dormitories with those of the same class (Fighters, Wizards, etc.).

Grand dinner to be served on first day. TitanPelt staff are mostly Aarakocra. 
[[Saxum Dustrunner]] met intern at the labs, tinkering away at his machine. 
Vale changed to neutral form to blend in, listening in on conversations, looking for skills they are flexing. (Appears to be only Changeling, very few Genasi.) 
[[Eskender Kumbukani]] looking for food - raw food. Found some birds sitting on a post and tried to grab them, did not. 
[[Imn Du’Alik]] walking around to take in all of the sights, see all of the people, clothes, weapons etc. that she’s never seen. 


[[Saxum Dustrunner]] met Wilbur Fellowdust(?) - toy maker, fellow contestant. 

Session 1: 7/14 (DM Notes)

Additional flavor/clarification: everyone arrives at Caelkirk, going to their assigned dorms. Dorms are split up by DND Class. 

[[Imn Du’Alik]] goes to the armory and gets some Plate armor fitted to her and picks it up the day of the trials. 

[[Vale]] finds and makes friends with Marcus Heraldbringer, a Paladin from a rich family. He liked that Vale fed his ego and joined his entourage of ass kissers. While out and about, Vale’s non essential items get stolen by another Rogue.

During [[Vale]]’s initial trial, he has some struggles getting through the sneaking obstacle course. On his third attempt, he makes it through. While not the worst performance he is not standing out. Thelma (Rogue Proctor) speaks to Vale afterwards, and gives him an unassuming coin. It’s hard to tell if it’s good or bad luck. Vale shows off his Changling abilities and this seems to impress Thelma, and she takes the coin back letting Vale know not to trust other Rogues and it was a coin of Ill luck.

[[Saxum Dustrunner]] gets directions to the workshop area to tinker on stuff. He tries to talk to the other Wizards and Artificers there, but all except Wilbur Billowdust give him the time of day. Wilbur is a very excited fellow and doesn’t have great self control in terms of knowing when to stop talking. He does give Saxum some possibly helpful advice for his future Steel Defender. In talking to the intern, Saxum gets the idea that working at Titanpelt is very cut throat.

[[Eskender Kumbukani]] hunts for birds, and finds a small murder of crows however he is not stealthy enough and they notice his attempt to try and get them. In the dining hall, he becomes friends with Razh, a Loxodon Barbarian and utterly embarrasses him leaving him unconscious in the dining hall.

[[Eskender Kumbukani]] enters a fighting circle with Razh and Kilid, two other Barbarian participants. The fight starts out rough with all the participants seemingly flailing at one another to nearly no success. Eventually, Razh is able to take down Eskender and Kilid to win the bout. Eskender wakes up in the triage, and begins to flail around. Anticipating that most of the Martial folks might have an adverse reaction when they wake up, the healers stay back. Tilrac (Barbarian Proctor) is there when he wakes up. He mentions he noticed that it seemed like [[Eskender Kumbukani]] had a target on his back from the beginning. They have a bit of a heated discussion and Tilrac recommends he might benefit in the future from not always making himself a target. 

We ended with completing the practical portion of [[Vale]] and [[Eskender Kumbukani]]’s trials. We have Saxum and then Imn and then will get to the questionnaire portion for everyone. After everyone’s questionnaire portion the group will level up to level 2.
