We return to our heroes at the main security gate of Titanpelt HQ. Everyone is given and attuned to a security badge crystal which they are told will give them access around the Titanpelt HQ campus. While attuned this crystal floats around them and pulses with a magical glow, but it seems like each individual is only able to see their own crystal they are attuned to. 
They continue around with their entourage with a tour of Titanpelt, with their massive security entourage and are taken to a R&D Building where they meet husbands Butch T Cougar and Harry who are the heads of Magical Rings and Cloaks. They are shown how Titanpelt is able to make magical items from start to finish, using a large and powerful Magical Tesla Coil like machine. Saxum asks questions and passes along a business card of his.

Butch and Harry say they wouldn’t mind taking him along as an apprentice if he isn’t selected as one of the 4 for the Hero Initiative. [[Saxum Dustrunner]] asks if they know more information about the project but they said they don’t and it’s been a highly secretive project.

Something the group has noticed is that while there is a lot of Titanpelt security here, they noticed secret service type security as well, specifically around R&D and the main T-Shaped executive building.
They are taken into the main Titanpelt Executive building and there is a mini history of Titanpelt’s history showing how Titanpelt has been involved in major Augard history events. They see a statue of Magnus Titanpelt who was the original founder of Titanpelt Industries and now his daughter Lila is the President/CEO.

The group is taken to a teleportation circle/warp zone up to a different floor in the buildings. It is a very plain floor with no windows or doors. There are many Titanpelt and Secret Service individuals here, they are given a very serious warning about not trying any funny business and their magic equipment and weapons are taken from them for the time being. 

They then are taken to another floor to agree and be under the dreaded NDA spell. While the group is hesitant, they eventually agree.

They finally are taken up to meet Lila but as they are teleported into her office, they also meet President Bilben Finediggles who is the current President of Augard. Bilben gives a very politician type introduction and Lila seems annoyed by his over the top antics. She reminds him that this isn’t a political event and he doesn’t need to worry about his campaign funds drying up anytime soon. 

Lila speaks with the group letting them know about the Hero Initiative project. Essentially the group will be completing various levels with different challenges and leveling up in the process. They will unlock abilities (leveling up DND character wise) after each level. When they complete the project they will have unlocked the ability for Titanpelt to then level up folks to level 20 at any given time.

They are given a brief history of the project that they have tried before and it has never been stable enough before but they have found a way to make it stable for 4 adventurers to complete. They are told they will need to complete one last level and that their personal lives and experiences may impact this level they go through. The first 4 adventurers that complete the challenge will make it into HOME HQ and be in the project. They are then given the opportunity to list a beneficiary in case the project ends up failing of who their gold goes to. After agreeing to be part of the project, they then are taken to individual hangar buildings in R&D and their security badge crystal begins to glow and then magical energy begins to flow. 

The characters feel like they are in the middle of the ocean during a storm and feel like they are drowning. They feel like they are about to pass out and each awake in their own individual level.

[[Eskender Kumbukani]] wakes up in a battlefield, but not just any battlefield…this is where well at least in a different life or body he was slain. The land is flooded with bones and viscera of his defeated enemies and he hears his previous voice in infernal talk to him, telling him to strike down his old self and be born anew. He makes it up to the top of the hill, where he had previously fallen and sees his old form. After letting this anger get the best of him a couple times marching up the hill he sees his old form but he is not as confident as he normally is. [[Eskender Kumbukani]] runs in recklessly, cutting down his old form instantly and seeing he has completed his level and a portal opens to the next part.

We move to [[Imn Du’Alik]] who wakes up deep in a mine. She has a map, lantern, and pickaxe on her and isn’t able to discern any relevant info from the map before it crumbles away. Rocks begin to fall from above but she is able to dodge them. After going through a tunnel that seems to lead to an open cavern, the path behind caves forces her forward. She reaches a minecart track and is able to navigate it, avoiding possible collisions and falling off the track entirely. After reaching the end of the cart track a portal opens up for her completing the level.

We next go to [[Vale]] who is seated across from Gideon at a booth in a speakeasy establishment. Gideon pushes a letter toward him which lets him know he needs to find a VIP and get their key to their suite, once in the suite he will need to get a ring from a jewelry box. There are 4 tables of patrons and after disguising himself as a server and convincing the staff he is meant to be there, he cleans up the cups/cans near a passed out smelly patron who is by themselves at a table and doesn’t seem like they can be woken up. He then helps end a terribly awkward blind date to gain advantage on a roll. He then pick pockets some gold from some celebrating workers who just got paid and then goes to gamble. While initially successful in gambling, the second game with some higher stakes goes in the house's favor. He then pick pockets some more gold and then is able to win the secondary prize which leads to one of the security guards grabbing the VIP key off the passed out individual. Now that the suite is open, there are 3 identical jewelry boxes on the table. Vale attempts the 1st and 3rd jewelry boxes and it turns out they are mimics biting [[Vale]]’s hands in the process. Now he has completed his challenge and a portal has opened up for him.

Finally we arrive with Saxum, who is in a makeshift Titanpelt field laboratory. He is able to tell that he is near his home village and he can also tell this is before the tragedy that happened to his village. He is able to find pristine versions of the parts he found in his home village after the incident, and is able to see how to put together everything into a Steel Defender and customize the way it looks. He is then ushered into a freight elevator to go deep into a mountain that Titanpelt has excavated. Even before he enters the mountain to take the elevator down, he senses a strong connection to the Earth Elemental plane. This only gets stronger the further down the elevator he goes and when he reaches the bottom, he sees there is an open portal to the earth elemental plane and one of Titanpelt’s Tesla Coil like machines with energy crackling from it. He sees a younger Earthspeaker Soot attacking Titanpelt staff and then damaging the machine. Out of the portal a giant Earth Elemental Titan connects with [[Saxum Dustrunner]] revealing that its name is Calas and it uses its body to shield Soot from the exploding machine. Then corrupted magic begins to flow and crack the earth, the cave begins to collapse in. It seems like Calas gave Soot instructions on how to escape in its sacrifice to protect her. And [[Saxum Dustrunner]] sees the beginning of the tragedy that befell his people. A portal opens up for him as he has successfully completed his challenge.

All the players go through their portals after completing their level with Vale coming out last. They walk out into a large empty room with a portal at the end, but then a giant dragon's head appears in the middle of the floor using a breath attack on [[Eskender]], [[Imn Du’Alik]], and [[Saxum Dustrunner]]. It instantly kills them leaving only [[Vale]] alive, then disappearing immediately after.

[[Vale]] walks through the door, and has reached HOME HQ and is greeted by the entire group all alive and now a level stronger than before. They are greeted by the staff and given a run down of the establishment. 

This is where the players will call home between levels. This place seems to lie directly in the plane of magic, and is highly experimental and seems stable. As the players entered, they arrived in a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm. There are countless staff of near-transparent servants attending all who enter. They are completely obedient to your orders unless it contradicts any directive they may have. Each servant can perform any task a normal human servant could perform, but they can’t attack or take any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in HOME but can’t leave. Their home is very similar to the magnificent mansion spell and there are many places to explore including a library, armory, arcane testing, magical ingredient cultivating and harvesting to name some of the locations.
