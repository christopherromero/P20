|Lila Titanpelt      |Eshhelion                     |CEO/President of Titanpelt. A Elven woman who looks like she is in her early 40s, tall (6 feet) and slender build. While she is the most powerful person in Augard and probably never had to get her hands “dirty” that she has actually contributed and you can tell that her hands are of those that still to this day work, while not as often in the laboratory. She has dark brown hair, that is silky/shiny that goes down about shoulder length. Typically seen in a suit of some variety. When she enters a room, a silence seems to come over it, her blue eyes pierce through the soul of anyone who dares step out of line in her presence. |                                                                                                  |
