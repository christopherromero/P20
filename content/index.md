Augard is an advanced nation, roughly the same size and shape of the continental USA. Thanks to the advancements of Titanpelt Industries, Augard became a leader in nearly everything imaginable and has known peace for over 1,000 years. The world is very magic heavy, and has a steampunk/Ebberon type feel to it. The nation has a democratically elected president and it is a melting pot of all available DND races. 

The general history that most people know about Augard is similar to the US that it’s founders came from other nations and over time, took over the land though mostly not great means. The original indigenous folks still live in Augard, although they say the true name of the land is Keyah.

There are 3 major biomes in Augard. The largest, and roughly 50% of the land mass was originally heavily forested and is a mountainous region covering the Western portion of the land. While there are still great forests, much has been cut down and there has been some effort through more modern magic to teraform some of Mountainous regions. A little over 40% of the population lives in the Western half of Augard.

Roughly a quarter that makes up the middle of Augard is a more desert climate, similar to Southwest and states like Arizona. In the past, stories were told of the extreme harsh climate but with magical advancement it is much more manageable and the extreme heat is but a thing of the past. Slightly less than 25% of the population lives in this region of Augard.

The remaining quarter of the land is mostly flat, glasslands with some mountains, but not nearly as tall or as expansive as the mountains that make up the Western portion of Augard. The remaining population lives in the Eastern portion of Augard with a disproportionate amount of folks living in the greater Inrith area.
