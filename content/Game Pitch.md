I wanted to start off, as while this is posted in all the Seattle Dungeons & Dragons and RPG events but I wanted to reiterate that I host a positive, friendly, and welcoming space for all adventurers, regardless of class, race, gender, age, or sexual identity. Any negativity fueled by real-world ignorance, hate, or fear will result in your removal/asked to leave the game and shared back to the MeetUp group.

Also if anyone has any off limit topics/subject matter, that I am more than willing to accommodate. I don’t need you to explain any further if you don’t want to or feel comfortable. Specific topics will be brought up and will go into more detail in a session zero but wanted to set that expectation from the beginning.

**Game Pitch:**
Game System & Edition

5 Edition Dungeons and Dragons

**Setting, style, theme, etc.**
Game is set in a homebrew world called Augard, very much inspired by Eberron/Steampunk vibes, more “advanced society” and magic is very prevalent. Augard is a nation that has known peace for over a 1,000 years. There have been no real wars, rebellions, attacks, anything of the sort. It has been a truly idyllic time for all. 

Titanpelt Industries, the Augard’s largest conglomerate has put out a call asking for the newest wave of up and coming adventurers to participate in its newest Hero initiative. Participants will be a part of Titanpelt’s next greatest innovation. They are specifically calling for new and up and coming adventurers (level 1). After completion of the project, each individual will be given 1 Million gold pieces. This messaging has been spread across Augard to every corner, no stone has been left unturned. All applicants will need to go to a local Hero showcase be evaluated and show their potential.

Titanpelt Industries is your stereotypical giant corporation/conglomerate that is in involved in seemingly everything. They started by making weapons and armor, but were able to crack how to craft magical items with precision and efficiency. The company is run by Lila Titanpelt. She isn’t known to make many public appearances, and rumors are that she rules with a iron fist.
  
We will start at level 1 and level to level 20. Fast paced/faster leveling type campaign. There will be multiple “levels”, video game like levels and after each one is completed then the characters will level up. There will be a specific theme to the levels which will be made very apparent and it will be easy to guess the up and coming themes. Each level will probably take multiple sessions to complete as there are specific goals per level. 
  
To complete each level you will need to use combat, skill checks, background, and other creative ways to get around the problems in each level.
  
 **Player info (# of players, beginner friendly, game level, existing players, beer 21+, etc.)**
 
 I’m open to as many as 6 players, will start at level one and plan to level up pretty quickly and hopefully get to level 20. No existing players, I’m personally fine if players drink/enjoy edibles unless it causes issues. I personally don’t drink very often or enjoy edibles on a regular basis so I wont be personally partaking before or during sessions.

  I’m open to all skill levels and the plan is for the game will be moving pretty quickly. I try not to retcon stuff as much as possible and expect players to have an idea of what their character can do. If you want to be a super min max player, go ahead. If you want to follow a specific theme or be a joke/meme player go ahead.

  Players can use point buy or standard array for stats. I will most likely give players a free feat at the beginning and will be asking players to choose what their “main class” is for something game related wise. This doesn’t mean you can’t multi class, but if you happen to play a ranger/rogue/fighter multiclass, only one of those will count as your “main class” for your character.

  I will have dice/minis for people if they don’t have their own. I will have maps done on a dry erase map, and have some dnd minis of specific monsters but no real fancy terrains and I don’t do a ton of voices.

**Location/Area or Online**

 In person gaming, I’m not really proficient with any of the online tools. I personally live in Kenmore (near Kirkland/Bothell) I am happy to host. Live in the suburbs, and have plenty of room/parking. Open to others hosting or finding a neutral site if that is what more people are comfortable with.

 I have a car and am open to driving to a more central location. I don’t mind driving into Seattle (assuming there is somewhat easy parking and not trying to get in during major traffic times).

**Day/Time/Frequency**

Open to pretty much any day. I would ideally like to have a weekend game, every other week, but am open to weekday. I could be open to a weekly game but I may be stretching myself too thin on that front.
